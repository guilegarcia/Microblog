Project designed to conduct a short course at the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), where I introduced fundamental concepts of Python and Django. The curriculum covered topics including Object-Oriented Programming, Django's architecture, and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) software design pattern. Participants acquired the skills to create a comprehensive Django project, ranging from environment setup to the development of a functional web application.
